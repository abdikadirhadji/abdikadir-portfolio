# 🔗 LinkedIn Profile Setup

## ✅ What's Been Updated

I've replaced the Resume button with LinkedIn throughout your portfolio:

1. **Navbar** - LinkedIn button (blue)
2. **Hero Section** - LinkedIn as primary button
3. **Contact Section** - LinkedIn added
4. **Footer** - LinkedIn link added

## 📝 Next Step: Add Your LinkedIn Profile URL

You need to update the LinkedIn URLs in these files:

### Files to Update:

1. **`components/Navbar.tsx`** (2 places - desktop & mobile)
   - Replace: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile`
   - With: Your actual LinkedIn profile URL

2. **`components/Hero.tsx`**
   - Replace: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile`
   - With: Your actual LinkedIn profile URL

3. **`components/Contact.tsx`**
   - Replace: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile`
   - With: Your actual LinkedIn profile URL

4. **`components/Footer.tsx`**
   - Replace: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile`
   - With: Your actual LinkedIn profile URL

## 🔍 How to Find Your LinkedIn URL

1. Go to your LinkedIn profile
2. Click "Edit public profile & URL" (or just view your profile)
3. Your URL will look like: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-name-123456/`
4. Copy that URL and replace `yourprofile` in the files above

## 💡 Why LinkedIn Instead of Resume?

✅ **Always up-to-date** - You update it once, it's current everywhere
✅ **Professional networking** - Recruiters and employers use it
✅ **More dynamic** - Shows recommendations, endorsements, connections
✅ **Industry standard** - Expected in modern portfolios
✅ **Easy to share** - One link works everywhere

## 📄 Resume Page Still Available

The Resume page (`/resume`) is still accessible if someone types the URL directly, but it's no longer prominently linked. This way:
- You can share the resume link when specifically needed
- Your portfolio focuses on LinkedIn (more professional)
- Less maintenance required

**Once you update the LinkedIn URLs, your portfolio will be complete!** 🚀
